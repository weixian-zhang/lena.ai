/**
 * Present a plan and stop for approval. Executes nothing — the model runs the approved
 * steps itself via `bash`, one at a time, so it sees each result before the next step
 * (CLAUDE.md: "sequential, supervised execution with reflection").
 *
 * `terminate: true` ends the run after this tool, so the model cannot follow its own plan
 * with a mutation in the same turn. Caveat: pi only terminates when *every* result in the
 * batch sets it (agent-loop.js `shouldTerminateToolBatch`), so a message batching
 * propose_plan with another call still continues. The `beforeToolCall` policy hook is
 * what closes that hole — this is a strong default, not the enforcement boundary.
 *
 * Approval is conversational: the user's next message ("approved", or a revision request)
 * starts the next run.
